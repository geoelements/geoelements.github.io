### Status updates
As a group, we meet on MWF at 10 AM to update everyone about the status of each project. The status update is a short two-minutes talk (no presentations) about your research progress and plans. The update should cover: 
- What you have been working on the last two days, 
- What is blocked, and 
- What is your plan for the next two days.
These quick status updates allow us to identify soon any aspect that you are having difficulties with or potentially blocking your research progress. We can immediately have a deep-dive meeting to resolve issues. On Mondays, we will discuss if you achieved the goals of last week and your plans for the current week. Monday's update should reflect the weekly project status update on Asana.

### Research project updates
Make sure your project on Asana is up to date. All in-progress tasks should have deadlines and an associated duration of when you expect to finish the task. Keep tasks short (<6 hours). Ensure you keep the tasks active and include a document explaining your findings/review/results when you move your task for review. Each project should update its status at the end of the week, preferably on Fridays and latest by Sunday. We will discuss the status/plan for each project on the Monday of each week.

### Deep dive meetings
All meetings should be booked online [https://calendly.com/krishnakut/30min](https://calendly.com/krishnakut/30min). These deep-dive meetings can be as frequent as you like if you feel stuck. But at minimum, we should meet once every two weeks. All meetings should have an Agenda and a Google doc describing the updates, questions on Asana Meeting Agenda. Please make sure the documents are available at least two hours before the meeting to prepare for our meeting, and the discussion is more productive. Sending documents beforehand eliminates the need to update me on your progress, and we can dive straight into the problem at hand. Please create the agenda with the following outline:
- How may I help you?
- To discuss
- Updates
- Next steps
- Goals

### Free flow meetings
Occasionally, one of our deep dive meetings or an impromptu meeting can be a free flow meeting. This meeting will have a core theme or context of what to discuss but will not happen in a lab/office in front of a computer. We will usually go for a walk and discuss Ph.D. life/career ideas or have a deep dive into your research problem while occasionally finding a spot to look at a graph or two. The free flow meetings are unconstrained, and we can get to know each other or the research problem at hand better.

### Brain Trust meetings
We'll have weekly [Brain Trust meetings](https://www.geoelements.org/meetings/brain%20trust/brain-trust-meetings/) to discuss research challenges and collectively find new research insights and troubleshoot problems.

### Mentor-Mentee 360
Mentor-Mentee 360 is a quarterly feedback loop between us (mentee and mentor) on the first week of the month. To prepare for the feedback loop, we will have a shared google document (private to you) and discuss the feedback/progress/plans/goals. True to its name, the meeting expects a true 360 feedback loop; you are encouraged to give your mentor feedback and say what's working and what's not without being judged. We'll cover the following topics:

- Feedback for your mentor, what's working and what's not?
- What excellent work have you done?
- What areas do you think you should improve?
- What are your goals for this quarter?
- How can your mentor help you?
- What skill would you like to develop/career advice?
