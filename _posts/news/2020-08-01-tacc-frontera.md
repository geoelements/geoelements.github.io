Geoelements team is delighted to have been awarded the TACC Frontera Pathways allocation to perform geological-scale simulations of landslides. We develop an open-source [CB-Geo MPM code](https://github.com/cb-geo/mpm) with graph-parallel dynamic load balancing capabilities to perform large-scale landslide simulations with billions of particles. We are excited to simulate the mechanical behavior and run-out evolution of a real landslide such as the Oso landslide in the US and the Kaikoura landslide in New Zealand, providing insights on the mechanisms of large-runout failures. TACC Frontera offers an unprecedented compute capability to pioneer geological-scale hazard assessment and will revolutionize earthquake-induced landslide research.
