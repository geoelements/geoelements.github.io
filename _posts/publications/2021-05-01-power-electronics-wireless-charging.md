When power electronics are deployed under the road surface as part of a wireless system it is important to know that
their packaging provides adequate heat extraction as well as the required environmental protection â€“ often conflicting
requirements. Presently very little can be found in wireless charging standards and literature on the topic of thermal
modelling for in-ground components. Yet, this is a topic of great practical significance especially for in-road systems. Traditional
cooling methods are not readily applicable underground. This paper uses finite element thermal modelling to investigate the
cooling of a representative medium-power in-road wireless system, housed in a sealed ground assembly (GA) chamber and
installed to UK requirements (HAUC). The paper quantitatively compares design options and provides practical recommendations
for in-road installation thermal management.
