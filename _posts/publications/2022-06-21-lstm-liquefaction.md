Shear stress history controls the pore pressure response in liquefiable soils. The excess pore pressure does not increase under cyclic loading when shear stress amplitude is lower than the peak prior amplitude -- the shielding effect. Many sophisticated constitutive models fail to capture the shielding effect observed in the cyclic liquefaction experiments. We develop a data-driven machine learning model based on the LSTM neural network to capture the liquefaction response of soils under cyclic loading. The LSTM model is trained on 12 laboratory cyclic simple shear tests on Nevada sand in loose and dense conditions subjected to different cyclic simple shear loading conditions. The LSTM model features include the relative density of soil and the previous stress history to predict the pore water pressure response. The LSTM model successfully replicates the pore pressure response for three cyclic simple test results considering the shielding and density effects.
