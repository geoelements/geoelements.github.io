Individual particle rotation and displacement were measured in triaxial tests on transparent sand stabilized with geogrid simulants. The Cellpose U-Net model, originally developed to segment biological cells, was trained to segment images of fused quartz particles. The Score-CAM metric from the field of Explainable AI was used to validate the application of Cellpose to segment particles of fused quartz. These segmented particles were characterized in terms of Fourier shape descriptors and tracked across images. The measured particle displacements in the monotonic triaxial tests correlated with displacement fields from Digital Image Correlation (DIC). In contrast to DIC, the new technique also allows for the measurement of individual particle rotation. The particle rotation measurements were found to be repeatable across different specimens. A state boundary line between probable and improbable particle motions could be identified for a given test based on the measured particle displacements and rotations. The size of the zone of probable motions was used to quantify the effectiveness of the stabilizing inclusions. The results of repeated load tests revealed that the honeycomb inclusions used stabilized the specimens by reducing both particle displacements and rotations.
