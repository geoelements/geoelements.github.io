This study utilizes a hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) and Material Point Method (MPM) to investigate the runout of liquefaction-induced flow slide failures. The key inputs to this analysis are the earthquake ground motion, which induces liquefaction, and the post-liquefaction residual strength. The influence of these factors on runout is evaluated by subjecting a model of a tailings dam to thirty different earthquake motions and by assigning different values of post-liquefaction residual strength. Ground motions with larger peak ground accelerations (PGA) generate liquefaction to larger depths, thus mobilizing a greater mass of material and resulting in a flow slide with greater runout. However, different ground motions with the same PGA yield significant variations in the depth of liquefaction, indicating that other ground motion characteristics (e.g., frequency content) also exert significant influence over the initiation of liquefaction. Ground motion characteristics of peak ground velocity (PGV) and Modified Acceleration Spectrum Intensity (MASI) show a strong correlation to the induced depth of liquefaction because they capture both the intensity and frequency content of the earthquake motion. The computed runout is directly related to the depth of liquefaction induced by the earthquake motion. For dam geometry analyzed, measurable runout occurs when liquefaction extends to 10 m depth and the runout is maximized when liquefaction extends to about 18 m. Strain-softening of the residual strength of the liquefied tailings during runout is shown to substantially increase the runout distance of the flow slide, highlighting the need for additional research to better characterize the appropriate strength of liquefied materials during flow failures.
