There is increasing interest in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by casting them as machine learning problems. Recently, there has been a spike in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing promise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely unexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex physical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional architectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs for learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance when applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based simulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in scale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation Theorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep network architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not consistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they demonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly outpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a promising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications involving physical systems.
