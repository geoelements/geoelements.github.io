Liquefaction results in a severe loss of strength in the retained soil and potentially failure of the dam. If the dam is breached, a massive debris flow of liquefied soil is then released with potentially...","categories": ["publications"],

Machine learning (ML) can improve lateral spreading prediction models by capturing complex soil characteristics and site conditions.
