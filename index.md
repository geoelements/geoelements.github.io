Geoelements is an interdisciplinary research group at UT Austin focused on advancing AI and numerical methods for robotics and control. Our research combines cutting-edge techniques including Gaussian Splatting, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Material Point Method (MPM), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable robots and autonomous systems to navigate and interact with complex, unstructured environments.
