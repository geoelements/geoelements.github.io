    <p>This study utilizes a hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) and Material Point Method (MPM) to investigate the runout of liquefaction-induced flow slide failures. The key inputs to this analysis are the earthquake ground motion, which induces liquefaction, and the post-liquefaction residual strength. The influence of these factors on runout is evaluated by subjecting a model of a tailings dam to thirty different earthquake motions and by assigning different values of post-liquefaction residual strength. Ground motions with larger peak ground accelerations (PGA) generate liquefaction to larger depths, thus mobilizing a greater mass of material and resulting in a flow slide with greater runout. However, different ground motions with the same PGA yield significant variations in the depth of liquefaction, indicating that other ground motion characteristics (e.g., frequency content) also exert significant influence over the initiation of liquefaction. Ground motion characteristics of peak ground velocity (PGV) and Modified Acceleration Spectrum Intensity (MASI) show a strong correlation to the induced depth of liquefaction because they capture both the intensity and frequency content of the earthquake motion. The computed runout is directly related to the depth of liquefaction induced by the earthquake motion. For dam geometry analyzed, measurable runout occurs when liquefaction extends to 10 m depth and the runout is maximized when liquefaction extends to about 18 m. Strain-softening of the residual strength of the liquefied tailings during runout is shown to substantially increase the runout distance of the flow slide, highlighting the need for additional research to better characterize the appropriate strength of liquefied materials during flow failures.</p>

    <p>This study proposes an autoencoder approach to extract latent features from cone penetration test profiles to evaluate the potential of incorporating CPT data in an AI model. We employ autoencoders to compress 200 CPT profiles of soil behavior type index (Ic) and normalized cone resistance (qc1Ncs) into ten latent features while preserving critical information. We then utilize the extracted latent features with site parameters to train XGBoost models for predicting lateral spreading occurrences in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Models using the latent CPT features outperformed models with conventional CPT metrics or no CPT data, achieving over 83% accuracy. Explainable AI revealed the most crucial latent feature corresponding to soil behavior between 1-3 meter depths, highlighting this depth range’s criticality for liquefaction evaluation. The autoencoder approach provides an automated technique for condensing CPT profiles into informative latent features for machine-learning liquefaction models.</p>

    <p>The effective stress parameter, χ, is essential for calculating the effective stress in unsaturated soils. Experimental measurements have captured different relationships between χ and the degree of saturation, Sr; however, they have not been able to justify the particular shapes of the χ-Sr curves. Theoretical solutions express χ as a function of Sr and the air-water interfacial area, awn; however, awn is difficult to predict, limiting further investigation of χ variation. We seek an alternative approach for studying χ by simulating the pore-scale distribution of the two fluid phases in unsaturated soils using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). We develop an algorithm for measuring χ based on the suction and surface tension forces applied to each grain. Using this algorithm, we simulate the χ-Sr curve over a full hydraulic cycle for a synthetic 3D granular soil column with immobile grains. We find that χ=1 at Sr=1 and χ=0 at Sr=0, while χ&gt;Sr for all other saturations. The maximum divergence of χ from Sr happens at the transition from/to the pendular regime. We also observe that the χ-Sr curve is hysteretic; χ is larger during wetting (imbibition) compared to drying (drainage) due to larger contribution of surface tension forces.</p>

    <p>This paper presents a hybrid Finite Element Method (FEM) and Material Point Method (MPM) approach for modeling liquefaction-induced tailings dam failures from initiation through runout. We apply this method to simulate the 1978 Mochikoshi tailings dam failure, which occurred due to seismic loading and liquefaction during an earthquake. Our approach leverages FEM to capture the initial failure mechanism and MPM to simulate the subsequent runout, exploiting the strength of each method in their respective phases of the failure process. We investigate the impact of the FEM-to-MPM transfer time on runout results, identifying an optimal transfer window. This window begins when liquefaction reaches a critical depth to fully trigger the failure and ends before excessive mesh deformation occurs. Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the liquefied tailings significantly influence runout predictions. Notably, we achieve runout distances comparable to the case history only when incorporating additional strain-softening beyond the initial liquefaction-induced strength reduction. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid FEM-MPM method effectively models tailings dam failures associated with complex failure mechanisms and large runouts. This approach offers a promising tool for predicting the runout of seismic liquefaction-induced tailings dam failures, improving risk assessment and mitigation strategies in tailings dam management.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a buzz word since Google’s AlphaGo beat a world champion in 2017. In the past five years, machine learning as a subset of the broader category of AI has obtained considerable attention in the research community of granular materials. This work offers a detailed review of the recent advances in machine learning-aided studies of granular materials from the particle-particle interaction at the grain level to the macroscopic simulations of granular flow. This work will start with the application of machine learning in the microscopic particle-particle interaction and associated contact models. Then, different neural networks for learning the constitutive behaviour of granular materials will be reviewed and compared. Finally, the macroscopic simulations of practical engineering or boundary value problems based on the combination of neural networks and numerical methods are discussed. We hope readers will have a clear idea of the development of machine learning-aided modelling of granular materials via this comprehensive review work.</p>

    <p>We present Basis-to-Basis (B2B) operator learning, a novel approach for learning operators on Hilbert spaces of functions based on the foundational ideas of function encoders. We decompose the task of learning operators into two parts: learning sets of basis functions for both the input and output spaces, and learning a potentially nonlinear mapping between the coefficients of the basis functions. B2B operator learning circumvents many challenges of prior works, such as requiring data to be at fixed locations, by leveraging classic techniques such as least-squares to compute the coefficients. It is especially potent for linear operators, where we compute a mapping between bases as a single matrix transformation with a closed form solution. Furthermore, with minimal modifications and using the deep theoretical connections between function encoders and functional analysis, we derive operator learning algorithms that are directly analogous to eigen-decomposition and singular value decomposition. We empirically validate B2B operator learning on six benchmark operator learning tasks, and show that it demonstrates a two-orders-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over existing approaches on several benchmark tasks.</p>

    <p>Numerical modeling of slope failures seeks to predict two key phenomena: the initiation of failure and the post-failure runout. Currently, most modeling methods for slope failure analysis excel at one of these two but are deficient in the other. For example, the Finite Element Method (FEM) models the initiation of instability well but quickly loses accuracy when modeling large deformations because of mesh distortion, restricting its ability to predict runout. Conversely, the Material Point Method (MPM) utilizes material points which move freely across a background grid, allowing for indefinite deformations without computational issues. However, MPM is restricted in its ability to model slope failure initiation due to limitations of the available boundary conditions and reduced accuracy of its stress distributions. The sequential hybridization of these two methods, initiating a model in FEM and then transferring to MPM, presents an opportunity to accurately capture both initiation and runout by a single model. The exact time for this transfer is not self-apparent, but it must be conducted after the initiation mechanism and before excessive mesh distortion. By simulating two granular column failures and two slope failures, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid FEM-MPM method and identify the appropriate time to transfer.</p>

    <p>Tailings dams impound large amounts of saturated soil which can be highly susceptible to liquefaction. Liquefaction results in a severe loss of strength in the retained soil and potentially failure of the dam. If the dam is breached, a massive debris flow of liquefied soil is then released with potentially disastrous consequences downstream. Numerical models are frequently utilized to predict the liquefaction response of tailings dams and the potential runout,
and these analyses inform engineering decisions regarding hazard avoidance and mitigation. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a widespread tool which excels at modeling liquefaction triggering and initial movements, but it quickly loses accuracy when modeling large deformations due to mesh distortion. Conversely, the Material Point Method (MPM), a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian method, employs particles that move freely across a background grid and can account for large deformations without losing accuracy. However, issues with the accuracy of MPM’s stress distributions and limits associated with the available boundary conditions impair its ability to predict liquefaction initiation. In this paper, we utilize a sequential hybridization of the FEM and MPM methods as a superior alternative to either individually. To demonstrate the efficacy of this hybrid method to simulate the entire process of tailings dam failures from initiation to runout, we model the 1978 Mochikoshi Tailings Dam failure. In this case, the dam collapsed during the main shaking of an earthquake due to the combined effects of the inertial seismic loading and liquefaction. We initiate this model in FEM to capture the immediate effects of the earthquake: the seismic response and liquefaction triggering. Then, we transfer the model into MPM, inheriting the FEM failure mechanism and capturing the runout behavior without mesh issues. The analysis successfully captures the liquefaction triggering and movements, but underestimates the final runout. Further refinements to the MPM phase of the analysis are required to better capture the large runout response.</p>

    <p>Inverse problems in granular flows, such as landslides and debris flows, involve estimating material parameters or boundary conditions based on target runout profile. Traditional high-fidelity simulators for these inverse problems are computationally demanding, restricting the number of simulations possible. Additionally, their non-differentiable nature makes gradient-based optimization methods, known for their efficiency in high-dimensional problems, inapplicable. While machine learning-based surrogate models offer computational efficiency and differentiability, they often struggle to generalize beyond their training data due to their reliance on low-dimensional input-output mappings that fail to capture the complete physics of granular flows. We propose a novel differentiable graph neural network simulator (GNS) by combining reverse mode automatic differentiation of graph neural networks with gradient-based optimization for solving inverse problems. GNS learns the dynamics of granular flow by representing the system as a graph and predicts the evolution of the graph at the next time step, given the current state. The differentiable GNS shows optimization capabilities beyond the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for inverse estimation across single and multi-parameter optimization problems, including evaluating material properties and boundary conditions for a target runout distance and designing baffle locations to limit a landslide runout. Our proposed differentiable GNS framework offers an orders of magnitude faster solution to these inverse problems than the conventional finite difference approach to gradient-based optimization.</p>

    <p>Reliable evaluations of geotechnical hazards like landslides and debris flow require accurate simulation of granular flow dynamics. Traditional numerical methods can simulate the complex behaviors of such flows that involve solid-like to fluid-like transitions, but they are computationally intractable when simulating large-scale systems. Surrogate models based on statistical or machine learning methods are a viable alternative, but they are typically empirical and rely on a confined set of parameters in evaluating associated risks. Due to their permutation-dependent learning, conventional machine learning models require an unreasonably large amount of training data for building generalizable surrogate models. We employ a graph neural network (GNN), a novel deep learning technique, to develop a GNN-based simulator (GNS) for granular flows to address these issues. Graphs represent the state of granular flows and interactions, like the exchange of energy and momentum between grains, and GNN learns the local interaction law. GNS takes the current state of the granular flow and estimates the next state using Euler explicit integration. We train GNS on a limited set of granular flow trajectories and evaluate its performance in a three-dimensional granular column collapse domain. GNS successfully reproduces the overall behaviors of column collapses with various aspect ratios that were not encountered during training. The computation speed of GNS outperforms high-fidelity numerical simulators by 300 times.</p>

    <p>Underground duct banks carrying power cables dissipate heat to the surrounding soil. The amount of heat dissipated determines the current rating of cables, which in turn affects the sizing of the cables. The dissipation of heat through the surrounding soils happens through conduction and convection. The mode of heat transfer depends on the soil’s thermal and hydraulic properties like diffusivity and permeability. The soil surrounding the cables could be designed to have maximum heat dissipation to have an improved current rating of cables. Differentiable programming is a novel technique that combines automatic differentiation with gradient-based optimization to minimize a loss function. Hence, differentiable programming can be used to evaluate input parameters based on output results. Given a desired heat distribution in the soil and a temperature source, we use differentiable programming to solve the inverse problem of estimating the soil permeability. In the present study, we employ differentiable programming to optimize the design of the buried duck bank and the backfill soil to improve heat dissipation. The design involves optimizing the permeability and size of the fill material compared to the surrounding natural soil. To implement automatic differentiation, we develop an inverse finite difference code in the Julia programming language and ForwardDiff package. We demonstrate the design capabilities of the differentiable programming technique to obtain the optimum permeability of the backfill material from the norm of the temperature distribution in the surrounding soil.</p>

    <p>In this study, we introduce an effective method for the inverse analysis of fluid flow problems,
focusing on accurately determining boundary conditions and characterizing the physical properties of gran-
ular media, such as permeability, and fluid components, like viscosity. Our primary aim is to deduce either
constant pressure head or pressure profiles, given the known velocity field at a steady-state flow through
a conduit containing obstacles, including walls, spheres, and grains. We employ the lattice Boltzmann
Method (LBM) combined with Automatic Differentiation (AD), facilitated by the GPU-capable Taichi
programming language (AD-LBM). A lightweight tape is utilized to generate gradients for the entire LBM
simulation, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. For complex flow paths in porous media, our AD-LBM
approach accurately estimates the boundary conditions leading to observed steady-state velocity fields and
consequently derives macro-scale permeability and fluid viscosity. Our method demonstrates significant ad-
vantages in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a powerful tool for solving
inverse fluid flow problems in various applications</p>

    <p>We leverage physics-embedded differentiable graph network simulators (GNS) to accelerate particulate and fluid simulations to solve forward and inverse problems. GNS represents the domain as a graph with particles as nodes and learned interactions as edges. Compared to modeling global dynamics, GNS enables learning local interaction laws through edge messages, improving its generalization to new environments. GNS achieves over 165x speedup for granular flow prediction compared to parallel CPU numerical simulations. We propose a novel hybrid GNS/Material Point Method (MPM) to accelerate forward simulations by minimizing error on a pure surrogate model by interleaving MPM in GNS rollouts to satisfy conservation laws  and minimize errors achieving 24x speedup compared to pure numerical simulations. The differentiable GNS enables solving inverse problems through automatic differentiation, identifying material parameters that result in target runout distances. We demonstrate the ability of GNS to solve inverse problems by iteratively updating the friction angle (a material property) by computing the gradient of a loss function based on the final and target runouts, thereby identifying the friction angle that best matches the observed runout. The physics-embedded and differentiable simulators open an exciting new paradigm for AI-accelerated design, control, and optimization.</p>

    <p>This paper presents a reflective analysis of a novel approach to Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to teach abstract concepts in a large-class setting, specifically tailored for a third-year required undergraduate course, “Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering.” The primary objective is to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes by employing forensic case studies-based learning, also known as murder mysteries. This unique adaptation of PBL offers a fresh perspective on teaching abstract concepts by introducing real-world engineering failures relevant to the topic. Students then identify potential reasons for failure, rank them, and cooperatively explore them. By progressing from the known to the unknown, students develop a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles they later encounter. by progressing from the known to the unknown This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional teaching methods that introduce abstract concepts before presenting real-world examples. The murder mysteries capture students’ attention and interest, allowing them to experience the process of doing real-world engineering. Consequently, the course rating improved significantly, achieving the highest score in the last twenty years - 4.9 out of 5.0, well above the average course rating of 3.8 during the same period. The paper delves into the background, methodology, challenges, and reflections on implementing and evaluating this engaging and effective PBL adaptation in a large-class setting for teaching abstract concepts in engineering.</p>

    <p>Accurate simulation of granular flow dynamics is crucial for assessing various geotechnical risks, including landslides and debris flows. Granular flows involve a dynamic rearrangement of particles exhibiting complex transitions from solid-like to fluid-like responses. Traditional continuum and discrete numerical methods are limited by their computational cost in simulating large-scale systems. Statistical or machine learning-based models offer an alternative. Still, they are largely empirical, based on a limited set of parameters. Due to their permutation-dependent learning, traditional machine learning-based models require huge training data to generalize. To resolve these problems, we use a graph neural network, a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture that learns local interactions. Graphs represent the state of dynamically changing granular flows and the interaction laws, such as energy and momentum exchange between grains. We develop a graph neural network-based simulator (GNS) that takes the current state of granular flow and predicts the next state using Euler explicit integration by learning the local interaction laws. We train GNS on different granular trajectories. We then assess the performance of GNS by predicting granular column collapse. GNS accurately predicts flow dynamics for column collapses with different aspect ratios unseen during training. GNS is hundreds of times faster than high-fidelity numerical simulators. The model also generalizes to domains much larger than the training data, handling more than twice the number of particles than it was trained on.</p>

We demonstrate our approach’s effectiveness through a case study on the natural hazard engineering dataset on ``LEAP Liquefaction’’ hosted on DesignSafe. Traditional lexical search on DesignSafe is limited in uncovering hidden relationships within the data. Our knowledge graph enables complex queries and fosters new scientific insights by accurately identifying relevant entities and establishing their relationships within the dataset.

However, GPT models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but false outputs, leading to hallucinations. In this article, we discuss the importance of prompt engineering in mitigating these risks and harnessing the full potential of GPT for geotechnical applications. We explore the challenges and pitfalls associated with LLMs and highlight the role of context in ensuring accurate and valuable responses. Furthermore, we examine the development of context-specific search engines and the potential of LLMs to become a natural interface for complex tasks, such as data analysis and design. We also develop a unified interface using natural language to handle complex geotechnical engineering tasks and data analysis. By integrating GPT into geotechnical engineering workflows, professionals can streamline their work and develop sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems for the future.</p>

    <p>We develop a PyTorch-based Graph Network Simulator (GNS) that learns physics and predicts the flow behavior of particulate and fluid systems.  GNS discretizes the domain with nodes representing a collection of material points and the links connecting the nodes representing the local interaction between particles or clusters of particles.  The GNS learns the interaction laws through message passing on the graph.  GNS has three components: (a) Encoder, which embeds particle information to a latent graph, the edges are learned functions; (b) Processor, which allows data propagation and computes the nodal interactions across steps; and (c) Decoder, which extracts the relevant dynamics (e.g., particle acceleration) from the graph.  We introduce physics-inspired simple inductive biases, such as an inertial frame that allows learning algorithms to prioritize one solution (constant gravitational acceleration) over another, reducing learning time.  The GNS implementation uses semi-implicit Euler integration to update the next state based on the predicted accelerations.  GNS trained on trajectory data is generalizable to predict particle kinematics in complex boundary conditions not seen during training.  The trained model accurately predicts within a 5% error of its associated material point method (MPM) simulation.  The predictions are 5,000x faster than traditional MPM simulations (2.5 hours for MPM simulations versus 20 s for GNS simulation of granular flow).  GNS surrogates are popular for solving optimization, control, critical-region prediction for in situ viz, and inverse-type problems. The GNS code is available under the open-source MIT license at https://github.com/geoelements/gns.</p>

    <p>We present a novel method of using explainability techniques to design physics-aware neural networks. We demonstrate our approach by developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for solving an inverse problem for shallow subsurface imaging. Although CNNs have gained popularity in recent years across many fields, the development of CNNs remains an art, as there are no clear guidelines regarding the selection of hyperparameters that will yield the best network. While optimization algorithms may be used to select hyperparameters automatically, these methods focus on developing networks with high predictive accuracy while disregarding model explainability (descriptive accuracy). However, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses the absence of model explainability by providing tools that allow developers to evaluate the internal logic of neural networks. In this study, we use the explainability methods Score-CAM and Deep SHAP to select hyperparameters, such as kernel sizes and network depth, to develop a physics-aware CNN for shallow subsurface imaging. We begin with a relatively deep Encoder-Decoder network, which uses surface wave dispersion images as inputs and generates 2D shear wave velocity subsurface images as outputs. Through model explanations, we ultimately find that a shallow CNN using two convolutional layers with an atypical kernel size of 3x1 yields comparable predictive accuracy but with increased descriptive accuracy. We also show that explainability methods can be used to evaluate the network’s complexity and decision-making. We believe this method can be used to develop neural networks with high predictive accuracy while also providing inherent explainability.</p>

    <p>Individual particle rotation and displacement were measured in triaxial tests on transparent sand stabilized with geogrid simulants. The Cellpose U-Net model, originally developed to segment biological cells, was trained to segment images of fused quartz particles. The Score-CAM metric from the field of Explainable AI was used to validate the application of Cellpose to segment particles of fused quartz. These segmented particles were characterized in terms of Fourier shape descriptors and tracked across images. The measured particle displacements in the monotonic triaxial tests correlated with displacement fields from Digital Image Correlation (DIC). In contrast to DIC, the new technique also allows for the measurement of individual particle rotation. The particle rotation measurements were found to be repeatable across different specimens. A state boundary line between probable and improbable particle motions could be identified for a given test based on the measured particle displacements and rotations. The size of the zone of probable motions was used to quantify the effectiveness of the stabilizing inclusions. The results of repeated load tests revealed that the honeycomb inclusions used stabilized the specimens by reducing both particle displacements and rotations.</p>

    <p>The water retention curve (WRC) defines the relationship between matric suction and saturation and is a key function for determining the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils. We investigate possible microscopic origins of the water retention behavior of granular soils using both Computed Tomography (CT) experiment and multiphase lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). We conduct a CT experiment on Hamburg sand to obtain its WRC and then run LBM simulations based on the CT grain skeleton. The multiphase LBM simulations capture the hysteresis and pore-scale behaviors of WRC observed in the CT experiment. Using LBM, we observe that the spatial distribution and morphology of gas clusters varies between drainage and imbibition paths and is the underlying source of the hysteresis. During drainage, gas clusters congregate at the grain surface; the local suction increases when gas clusters enter through small pore openings and decreases when gas clusters enter through large pore openings. Whereas, during imbibition, gas clusters disperse in the liquid; the local suction decreases uniformly. Large pores empty first during drainage and small pores fill first during imbibition. The pore-based WRC shows that an increase in pore size causes a decrease in suction during drainage and imbibition, and an increase in hysteresis.</p>

    <p>This paper presents a frequency-velocity convolutional neural network (CNN) for rapid, non-invasive 2D shear wave velocity (Vs) imaging of near-surface geo-materials. Operating in the frequency-velocity domain allows for significant flexibility in the linear-array, active-source experimental testing configurations used for generating the CNN input, which are normalized dispersion images. Unlike wavefield images, normalized dispersion images are relatively insensitive to the experimental testing configuration, accommodating various source types, source offsets, numbers of receivers, and receiver spacings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the frequency-velocity CNN by applying it to a classic near-surface geophysics problem, namely, imaging a two-layer, undulating, soil-over-bedrock interface. This problem was recently investigated in our group by developing a time-distance CNN, which showed great promise but lacked flexibility in utilizing different field-testing configurations. Herein, the new frequency-velocity CNN is shown to have comparable accuracy to the time-distance CNN while providing greater flexibility to handle varied field applications. The frequency-velocity CNN was trained, validated, and tested using 100,000 synthetic near-surface models. The ability of the proposed frequency-velocity CNN to generalize across various acquisition configurations is first tested using synthetic near-surface models with different acquisition configurations from that of the training set, and then applied to experimental field data collected at the Hornsby Bend site in Austin, Texas, USA. When fully developed for a wider range of geological conditions, the proposed CNN may ultimately be used as a rapid, end-to-end alternative for current pseudo-2D surface wave imaging techniques or to develop starting models for full waveform inversion.</p>

    <p>In situ visualization techniques are hampered by a lack of foresight: crucial simulation phenomena can be missed due to a poor sampling rate or insufficient detail at critical timesteps. Keeping a human in the loop is impractical, and defining statistical triggers can be difficult. This paper demonstrates the potential for using a machine-learning-based simulation surrogate as an oracle to identify expected critical regions of a large-scale simulation. These critical regions are used to drive the in situ analysis, providing greater data fidelity and analysis resolution with an equivalent I/O budget to a traditional in situ framework. We develop a distributed asynchronous in situ visualization by integrating TACC Galaxy with CB-Geo MPM for material point simulation of granular flows. We employ a PyTorch-based 3D Graph Network Simulator (GNS) trained on granular flow problems as an oracle to predict the dynamics of granular flows. Critical regions of interests are manually tagged in GNS for in situ rendering in MPM.</p>

    <p>Shear stress history controls the pore pressure response in liquefiable soils. The excess pore pressure does not increase under cyclic loading when shear stress amplitude is lower than the peak prior amplitude – the shielding effect. Many sophisticated constitutive models fail to capture the shielding effect observed in the cyclic liquefaction experiments. We develop a data-driven machine learning model based on the LSTM neural network to capture the liquefaction response of soils under cyclic loading. The LSTM model is trained on 12 laboratory cyclic simple shear tests on Nevada sand in loose and dense conditions subjected to different cyclic simple shear loading conditions. The LSTM model features include the relative density of soil and the previous stress history to predict the pore water pressure response. The LSTM model successfully replicates the pore pressure response for three cyclic simple test results considering the shielding and density effects.</p>

    <p>The performance evaluation of a potentially unstable slope involves two key components: the initiation of the slope failure and the post-failure runout. The Finite Element Method (FEM) excels at modeling the initiation of instability but quickly loses accuracy in modeling large-deformation problems due to mesh distortion. Hence, the FEM is unable to accurately model post-failure slope runout. Hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian methods, such as the Material Point Method (MPM), offer a promising alternative for solving large-deformation problems, because particles can move freely across a background mesh, allowing for large deformation without computational issues. However, the use of moving material points in MPM for integration rather than the fixed Gauss points of the FEM reduces the accuracy of MPM in predicting stress distribution and thus failure initiation. We have created a hybrid method by initiating a failure simulation in FEM and subsequently transferring the coordinates, velocities, and stresses to MPM particles to model the runout behavior, combining the strength of both methods. We demonstrate the capability of the hybrid approach by simulating the collapse of a frictional granular column, comparing it to an empirical solution, and evaluating a suitable time to transfer from FEM to MPM by trialing multiple iterations with transfers at different stages of the collapse.</p>

    <p>The soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) is the most fundamental relationship in unsaturated soil mechanics, relating the amount of water in the soil to the corresponding matric suction. From experimental evidence, it is known that SWCC exhibits hysteresis (i.e. wetting/drying path dependence). Various factors have been proposed as contributors to SWCC hysteresis, including air entrapment, contact angle hysteresis, ink-bottle effect, and change of soil fabric due to swelling and shrinkage, however, the significance of their contribution is debated. From our pore-scale numerical simulations, using the multiphase lattice Boltzmann method, we see that even when controlling for all these factors SWCC hysteresis still occurs, indicating that there is some underlying source that is not accounted for in these factors. We find this underlying source by comparing the liquid/gas phase distributions for simulated wetting and drying experiments of 2D and 3D granular packings. We see that during wetting (i.e. pore filling) many liquid bridges expand simultaneously and join together to fill the pores from the smallest to the largest, allowing menisci with larger radii of curvature (lower matric suction). Whereas, during drying (i.e. pore emptying), only the limited existing gas clusters can expand, which become constrained by the size of the pore openings surrounding them and result in menisci with smaller radii of curvature (higher matric suction).</p>

    <p>Inductive heating with high-voltage cables reduces the risk of hydrate formation by raising the temperature of the production fluid in pipelines. Heating the pipeline results in losing a certain fraction of the heat to the surrounding soil through conduction or convection-dominated flow through the soil. However, the amount of heat lost in conduction versus convection and the transition from conduction to convection-dominated heat loss remains unknown. Soil permeability, temperature gradient between cable and mudline, and burial depth influence the mode of heat transfer and the amount of heat lost. We study the dominant mode of heat transfer in pipelines with inductive heating using 2D Finite Difference analysis under different soil and environmental conditions. Low permeability soils primarily exhibit conductive heat transfer, thus losing minimum heat to the surrounding soil. In contrast, convective flow drives a significant fraction of the heat away from the pipeline and towards the ground surface for highly permeable soils, barely heating the fluid in the pipe. We identify a critical Rayleigh-Darcy number of 1 as the controlling value separating conduction and convection-dominated heat transfer. An increase in burial depth deteriorates the heating efficiency in convection-dominated high permeability soils, while it remains unaffected in conduction-dominated low permeability soils.</p>

    <p>Visualizing regional-scale landslides is the key to conveying the threat of natural hazards to stakeholders and policymakers. Traditional visualization techniques are restricted to post-processing a limited subset of simulation data and are not scalable to rendering exascale models with billions of particles. In-situ visualization is a technique of rendering simulation data in real-time, i.e., rendering visuals in tandem while the simulation is running. In this study, we develop a scalable N:M interface architecture to visualize regional-scale landslides. We demonstrate the scalability of the architecture by simulating the long runout of the 2014 Oso landslide using the Material Point Method coupled with the Galaxy ray tracing engine rendering 4.2 million material points as spheres. In-situ visualization has an amortized runtime increase of 2\% compared to non-visualized simulations. The developed approach can achieve in-situ visualization of regional-scale landslides with billions of particles with minimal impact on the simulation process.</p>

    <p>In nature, submarine slope failures usually carry thousands of cubic-meters of sediments across extremely long distances and cause tsunamis and damages to offshore structures. This paper uses the granular column collapse experiment to investigate the effect of slope angle on the runout behavior of submarine granular landslides for different initial volumes. A two-dimensional  coupled  lattice  Boltzman  and  discrete  element  method  (LBM-DEM)  approach  is  adopted  for  numerically modeling the granular column collapse. Columns with four different slope angles and six different volumes are modelled under both  dry  and  submerged  conditions.  The  effects  of  hydrodynamic  interactions,  including  the  generation  of  excess  pore pressures, hydroplaning, and drag forces and formation of turbulent vortices, are used to explain the difference in the runout behavior of the submerged columns compared to the dry columns. The results show that at any given slope angle, there is a threshold volume above which the submerged columns have a larger final runout compared to their dry counterpart, and this threshold volume decreases with slope angle.</p>

    <p>When power electronics are deployed under the road surface as part of a wireless system it is important to know that
their packaging provides adequate heat extraction as well as the required environmental protection – often conflicting
requirements. Presently very little can be found in wireless charging standards and literature on the topic of thermal
modelling for in-ground components. Yet, this is a topic of great practical significance especially for in-road systems. Traditional
cooling methods are not readily applicable underground. This paper uses finite element thermal modelling to investigate the
cooling of a representative medium-power in-road wireless system, housed in a sealed ground assembly (GA) chamber and
installed to UK requirements (HAUC). The paper quantitatively compares design options and provides practical recommendations
for in-road installation thermal management.</p>

    <p>Submarine landslides transport thousands of cubic meters of sediment across continental shelves even at slopes as low as 1° and can cause significant casualty and damage to infrastructure. The run-out mechanism in a submarine landslide is affected by factors such as the initial packing density, permeability, slope angle, and initial volume. While past studies have focused on the influence of density, permeability, and slope angle on the granular column collapse, the impact of volume on the run-out characteristics has not been investigated. This study aims to understand how the initial volume affects the run-out using a two-dimensional coupled lattice Boltzman and discrete element (LBM-DEM) method. The coupled LBM-DEM approach allows simulating fluid flow at the pore-scale resolution to understand the grain-scale mechanisms driving the complex continuum-scale response in the granular column collapse. For submerged granular column collapse, the run-out mechanism is heavily influenced by the interaction between the grains and the surrounding fluid. The development of negative pore pressures during shearing and hydrodynamic drag forces inhibit the flow. On the other hand, entrainment of water resulting in hydroplaning enhances the flow. With an increase in volume, the interaction between the grains and the surrounding fluid varies, causing changes in the run-out behavior. For smaller volumes, the forces inhibiting the underwater flow predominates, resulting in shorter run-outs than their dry counterparts. At large volumes, hydroplaning results in larger run-out than the dry cases, despite the inhibiting effects of drag forces and negative pore pressures.</p>

    <p>The soil water retention curve (SWRC) is the most commonly used relationship in the study of unsaturated soil. In this paper, the effect of porosity on the SWRC is investigated by numerically modeling unsaturated soil using the Shan-Chen multiphase Lattice Boltzmann Method. The shape of simulated SWRCs are compared against that predicted by the van Genuchten model, demonstrating a good fit except at low degrees of saturation. The simulated SWRCs show an increase in the air-entry value as porosity decreases.</p>

    <p>Compared to most other primates, humans are characterized by a tight fit between the maternal birth canal and the fetal head, leading to a relatively high risk of neonatal and maternal mortality and morbidities. Obstetric selection is thought to favor a spacious birth canal, whereas the source for opposing selection is frequently assumed to relate to bipedal locomotion. An alternative, yet under-investigated, hypothesis is that a more expansive birth canal suspends the soft tissue of the pelvic floor across a larger area, which is disadvantageous for continence and support of the weight of the inner organs and fetus. To test this “pelvic floor hypothesis” we generated a finite element model of the human female pelvic floor and varied its radial size and thickness while keeping all else constant. This allowed us to study the effect of pelvic geometry on pelvic floor deflection (i.e., the amount of bending from the original position) and tissue stresses and stretches. Deflection grew disproportionately fast with increasing radial size, and stresses and stretches also increased. By contrast, an increase in thickness increased pelvic floor stiffness - i.e. the resistance to deformation - which reduced deflection but was unable to fully compensate for the effect of increasing radial size. Moreover, larger thicknesses increase the intra-abdominal pressure necessary for childbirth. Our results support the pelvic floor hypothesis and evince functional trade-offs affecting not only the size of the birth canal but also the thickness and stiffness of the pelvic floor.</p>

    <p>Non-invasive subsurface imaging using full waveform inversion (FWI) has the potential to fundamen-tally change engineering site characterization by enabling the recovery of high resolution 2D/3D maps ofsubsurface stiffness.  Yet, the accuracy of FWI remains quite sensitive to the choice of the initial start-ing model due to the complexity and non-uniqueness of the inverse problem.  In response,  we presentthe  novel  application  of  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs)  to  transform  an  experimental  seismicwavefield acquired using a linear array of surface sensors directly into a robust starting model for 2DFWI.  We  begin  by  describing  three  key  steps  used  for  developing  the  CNN,  which  include:  selectionof a network architecture, development of a suitable training set, and performance of network training.The ability of the trained CNN to predict a suitable starting model for 2D FWI was compared againstother commonly used starting models for a classic near-surface imaging problem; the identification of anundulating, two-layer, soil-bedrock interface.  The CNN developed during this study was able to predictcomplex 2D subsurface images of the testing set directly from their seismic wavefields with an averagemean absolute percent error of 6%.  When compared to other common approaches, the CNN approachwas able to produce starting models with smaller seismic image and waveform misfits, both before andafter FWI. The ability of the CNN to generalize to subsurface models which were dissimilar to the onesupon which it was trained was assessed using a more complex, three-layered model.  While the predictiveability of the CNN was slightly reduced, it was still able to achieve seismic image and waveform misfitscomparable to the other commonly used starting models.  This study demonstrates that CNNs have greatpotential as a tool for developing good starting models for FWI, which are critical for producing accurateFWI results.</p>

    <p>A new thixotropic model is developed integrating the Papanastasiou-Bingham model with thixotropy equations to simulate the flow behaviour of Tremie Concrete in the Material Point Method framework. The effect of thixotropy on the rheological behaviour of fresh concrete is investigated by comparing field measurements with numerical simulations. The comparison yields new insights into a critical and often overlooked behaviour of concrete. A parametric study is performed to understand the effect of model parameters and rest-time on the shear stress response of fresh concrete. The Material Point Method with the Papanastasiou-Bingham model reproduces slump-flow measurements observed in the field. The novel model revealed a decline in concrete workability during the Slump-flow test after a period of rest due to thixotropy, which the physical version of the test fails to capture. This reduction in workability significantly affects the flow behaviour and the effective use of fresh concrete in construction operation.</p>
