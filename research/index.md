        <h3>MPM: Material Point Method</h3>
        <p>The Material Point Method (MPM) is a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, which uses moving material points and computational nodes on a background mesh. This approach is very effective particularly in the context of large deformations.</p>

        <h3>LBM/DEM: Lattice Boltzmann & Discrete Element Method</h3>
        <p>The Lattice Boltzmann equation Method (LBM) is a meso-scale fluid solver for modeling grain-scale fluid flow. The Discrete-Element Method (DEM) is coupled with LBM to model soil-fluid interactions at particulate scale.</p>
