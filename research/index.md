## Numerical Methods

### [Material Point Method]({{ site.url }}/research/mpm/)

The Material Point Method (MPM) is a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, which uses moving material points and computational nodes on a background mesh. This approach is very effective particularly in the context of large deformations.

### [Lattice Boltzmann Method]({{ site.url }}/research/lbm/)

The Lattice Boltzmann equation Method (LBM) is a meso-scale fluid solver for modeling grain-scale fluid flow. The Discrete-Element Method (DEM) is coupled with LBM to model soil-fluid interactions at particulate scale.

### eXplainable-AI (X-AI) and Machine Learning

X-AI and ML research focuses on discovering new physics using a data-driven approach. We explain ML algorithms using post-hoc approaches and developing fully-interpretable glass-box ML algorithms.
