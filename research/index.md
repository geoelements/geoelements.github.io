Our research group is dedicated to exploring advanced numerical methods and innovative techniques that bridge the gap between traditional simulations and modern data-driven approaches. Below are our primary areas of focus:

### [Material Point Method]({{ site.url }}/research/mpm/)

The Material Point Method (MPM) is a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, which uses moving material points and computational nodes on a background mesh. This approach is very effective particularly in the context of large deformations.

### [Lattice Boltzmann Method]({{ site.url }}/research/lbm/)

The Lattice Boltzmann equation Method (LBM) is a meso-scale fluid solver for modeling grain-scale fluid flow. The Discrete-Element Method (DEM) is coupled with LBM to model soil-fluid interactions at particulate scale.

### [Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) and Differentiable Programming]({{ site.url }}/research/ml/)

Our research on SciML and differentiable programming focuses on discovering new physics using a data-driven approach and AI-accelerated simulations.
