Material Point Method (MPM) is a particle based method that represents the
material as a collection of material points, and their deformations are
determined by Newtonâ€™s laws of motion. The MPM is a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian
approach, which uses moving material points and computational nodes on a background mesh.
This approach is very effective particularly in the context of large deformations.

> Illustration of the MPM algorithm (1) A representation of material points overlaid on
a computational grid. Arrows represent material point state vectors (mass, volume, velocity, etc.)
being projected to the nodes of the computational grid. (2) The equations of motion are solved onto
the nodes, resulting in updated nodal velocities and positions. (3) The updated nodal kinematics
are interpolated back to the material points. (4) The state of the material points is updated, and the
computational grid is reset
